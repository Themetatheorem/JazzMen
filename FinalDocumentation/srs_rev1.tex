\section{Project Drivers}

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Purpose of Project} % Jasman
\subsubsection{Project Background}
Social media is a place for small talk, discussion and sharing of ideas. Social media includes many different platforms used by hundreds of millions of people across the globe. Big organizations can utilize these platforms in order to imporove their own reputations as well as figuring out different ways to increase their customer base. Using social media, these companies can discover what the public eye thinks of them.\\

\subsubsection{Goal of the project}
The purpose of Sentments Analysis with Twitter is to provide a way for
business analyst to see what is being said about a company on social media. This project also provides benchmark analysis which would help business' compare and contrast two potential companies and why one is doing good in the public eye and the other not so much.

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Stakeholders}\label{SubSec_Stakeholders} % Jasman
The projects current stakeholders are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Team Jazz Men
\item Dr. Wenbo (The project supervisor)
\item Dynamic business'
\end{itemize}
	
\subsubsection{The Customer}
The customers for this project include various companies or analysts that wish to utilize the software in order to receive dynamic feedback from the community for both public and private businesses. The customer will use the software to analyze and make decisions on how they will operate according to the reactions of the community to different aspects of a company.

\subsubsection{The Hands-On Users of the Product}
Analysts will be the hands-on users for the application. They will all have the necessary knowledge to be able to use the information given to them.
\subsubsection{Personas}
Consider Bob Mellow, an analyst working at FootLocker. Bob wants to study how people see the company through the eyes of the public and how it may be improved. Bob knows how to conduct an analysis of the publics opinion, but it will take way too long to collect an accurate dyamic data set. Bob can now input the name of the company he wishes to conduct an analysis on and generate a report with various filters. He will then be presented with results displayed on a webpage for him to examine which could have taken weeks otherwise.

\section{Project Constraints}

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Mandated Constraints} % Jasman
There are global constraints put in place by the existing software, the stakeholders, and the structure of the course (Computer Science 4ZP6). The project must be built upon the existing applications being used to aid in the generation of the analysis (Twitter and IBM Watson Sentiment). The final code should be able to display any current data extracted from the prior on a web application. The web application should be able to correctly display on any web browser. Finally, the final product must be completed by the end of April, 2017. If the global constraints are not met, then the final product is not acceptable.\\
