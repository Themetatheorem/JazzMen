\section{Overview}

The purpose of this document is to provide an initial plan for the testing of our project and application. The following gives out a brief outline and an overview of what is discussed in this document:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A proof of concept is described in section 3
		\item The different variations of test cases to be tested are described in section 5
		\item Each test case is categorized based on whether it is for a functional or non-functional requirement in sections 5.1 and 5.2
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Test Case Format}
	Each test case is formatted as shown below:

	\begin{mdframed}[linewidth=1pt]
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}p{3cm}X@{}}
	{\bf Test:} & {\bf Test name}\\[\baselineskip]
	{\bf Requirement:} & {\bf Requirement Type}\\[\baselineskip]
	{\bf Description:} & A description of the test being conducted\\[0.5\baselineskip]
	{\bf Initial State:} & Initial State of system before the test begins\\[0.5\baselineskip]
	{\bf Input:} &  The input to the system that will change the system's state\\[0.5\baselineskip]
	{\bf Output:} & The relevant output that is observed\\[0.5\baselineskip]
	{\bf Pass:} & The pass criteria describes what is acceptable as a successful test based on the requirements of the system

\section{Proof of Concept Testing}
\section{Significant Risks}
To successfully accomplish this project, the risks mentioned below must be taken account for:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reliability of server
	\item Effective web UI design
	\item Ensuring website is portable (mobile and desktop friendly)
	\item Ensuring website is accessible for those with disabilities
	
\end{enumerate}



\section{Demonstration Plan}
For the proof of concept demonstration, we will be creating a working prototype of our sentiment analysis program. Initially the results will be generated using the keywords "McMaster University". We will then utilize the Bootstrap Framework in order to develop the front end side of the webpage where the results are to be displayed in a more appealing format. \\

The prototype will run the sentiment analysis API using a given keyword which will then take the generated results and display them in a tabular format. Using the given keyword, the sentiment API combined with the Twitter API will work together to retrieve tweets and score each one. These scores will then be formatted in a presentable manner and displayed onto the webpage. The users can then sift through the tweets to see the positive and negative comments regarding the given keyword (Figure 1).

\section{Demonstration Plan}
For the proof of concept demonstration, we will be making a working prototype consisting of an analysis of sentiments through the key term "McMaster University". We will then use the Bootstrap Framework to develop the front end of the web page in order to display the results to the public.\\

The prototype will run the sentiment analysis API using the keywords and with the help of the Twitter API, it will sift through tweets using the keywords and generate results. These results will then be displayed in a tabular format for users to view. The score will be formatted in an understandable manner to the users, allowing users to view both positive and negative spectrum of the results.

\section{Testing}


	\subsection{Automated Testing}
	All unit testing for this project will be automated to save time. Unit tests will be created and tested as the project is developed. These unit tests will be separated by different modules including Python unit testing and Javascript unit testing.
